# Machine Learning Paper Reviews

My paper review as per as I understand. A good habit inspired by [Patrick Langechuan Liu](https://github.com/patrick-llgc/Learning-Deep-Learning).
These are hand written notes, please mind the handwriting.

## Note
This repo mainly contains paper reading about my research: Computer Vision + Vioalation of Expectation in Physics (Machine Common Sense)
